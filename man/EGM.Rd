}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Matrix or data frame.
Should consist only of variables to be used in the analysis.
Can be raw data or a correlation matrix}

\item{EGM.model}{Character vector (length = 1).
Sets the procedure to conduct \code{EGM}.
Available options:

\itemize{

\item \code{"explore"} --- A two-step procedure where the first step estimates
network loadings for Walktrap community structures up to \code{communities} using the
standard beta-min condition to threshold the network. The second step computes networks
using the community-aware beta-min criterion based on the
loading-implied partial correlation matrices from the previous step. The
network (corresponding to communities and a set of loadings) with the lowest
BIC is selected as the model. An optional (but recommended and default) procedure is to
optimize the network toward the model-implied zero-order correlation matrix
(`network.optimize = TRUE`); otherwise, the community-aware beta-min criterion is used
on the model-implied partial correlation matrix.

\item \code{"EGA"} (default) --- Applies \code{\link[EGAnet]{EGA}} to obtain the
(sparse) regularized network structure, communities, and memberships

\item \code{"probability"} --- Estimates communities based on the non-regularized
empirical partial correlation matrix and sparsity is set using probabilities for the
within- (\code{p.in}) and between-community (\code{p.out}) connectivity

}}

\item{communities}{Numeric vector (length = 1).
Number of communities to use for the \code{"standard"} type of EGM.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.
Providing no input will use the communities and memberships output
from the Walktrap algorithm (\code{\link[igraph]{cluster_walktrap}}) based
on the empirical non-regularized partial correlation matrix}

\item{structure}{Numeric or character vector (length = \code{ncol(data)}).
Can be theoretical factors or the structure detected by \code{\link[EGAnet]{EGA}}.
Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{search}{Boolean (length = 1).
Whether a search over parameters should be conducted.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
Set to \code{TRUE} to select a model over a variety of parameters that
optimizes the \code{opt} objective}

\item{p.in}{Numeric vector (length = 1).
Probability that a node is randomly linked to other nodes in the same community.
Within community edges are set to zero based on \code{quantile(x, prob = 1 - p.in)}
ensuring the lowest edge values are set to zero (i.e., most probable to \emph{not}
be randomly connected).
Only used for \code{EGM.type = "standard"}.
Defaults to \code{NULL} but must be set}

\item{p.out}{Numeric vector (length = 1).
Probability that a node is randomly linked to other nodes \emph{not} in the same community.
Between community edges are set to zero based on \code{quantile(x, prob = 1 - p.out)}
ensuring the lowest edge values are set to zero (i.e., most probable to \emph{not}
be randomly connected).
Only used for \code{EGM.type = "standard"} and \code{search = FALSE}.
Defaults to \code{NULL} but must be set}

\item{opt}{Character vector (length = 1).
Fit index used to select from when searching over models
(only applies to \code{search = TRUE}).
Available options include maximum likelihood (default; \code{"logLik"}) and
standardized root mean residual (\code{"SRMR"})}

\item{model.select}{Character vector (length = 1).
Criterion to select the best fitting model.
Defaults to \code{"AIC"}.

\emph{Note: BIC tends to overly penalize models with more communities, use with caution}}

\item{constrain.structure}{Boolean (length = 1).
Whether memberships of the communities should
be added as a constraint when optimizing the network loadings.
Defaults to \code{TRUE} which ensures assigned loadings are
guaranteed to never be smaller than any cross-loadings.
Set to \code{FALSE} to freely estimate each loading similar to exploratory factor analysis}

\item{constrain.zeros}{Boolean (length = 1).
Whether zeros in the estimated network loading matrix should
be retained when optimizing the network loadings.
Defaults to \code{TRUE} which ensures that zero networks loadings are retained.
Set to \code{FALSE} to freely estimate each loading similar to exploratory factor analysis}

\item{optimize.network}{Boolean (length = 1).
Whether the model-implied network should be optimized toward the
model-implied zero-order correlation matrix.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.

Only applies to `EGM.model = "explore"`}

\item{verbose}{Boolean (length = 1).
Should progress be displayed?
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
Set to \code{FALSE} to not display progress}
