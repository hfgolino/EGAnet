\title{Simulate data following a Exploratory Graph Model (\code{\link[EGAnet]{EGM}})}
\usage{
simEGM(
  communities,
  variables,
  loadings,
  cross.loadings = 0.01,
  correlations,
  sample.size,
  p.in = 0.95,
  p.out = 0.8,
  max.iterations = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{communities}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of communities to generate}

\item{variables}{Numeric vector (length = 1 or \code{communities}).
Number of variables per community}

\item{loadings}{Numeric (length = 1).
Magnitude of the assigned network loadings.
For reference, small (0.20), moderate (0.35), and large (0.50)

Uses \code{runif(n, min = value - 0.075, max = value + 0.075)} for some jitter in the loadings}

\item{cross.loadings}{Numeric (length = 1).
Standard deviation of a normal distribution with a mean of zero (\code{n, mean = 0, sd = value}).
Defaults to \code{0.01}.
Not recommended to change too drastically (small increments such as \code{0.01} work best)}

\item{correlations}{Numeric (length = 1).
Magnitude of the community correlations

Uses \code{runif(n, min = value - 0.025, max = value + 0.025)}
for some jitter in the correlations}

\item{sample.size}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of observations to generate}

\item{p.in}{Numeric (length = 1).
Sets the probability of retaining an edge \emph{within} communities.
Single values are applied to all communities.
Defaults to \code{0.95}}

\item{p.out}{Numeric (length = 1 or \code{communities}).
Sets the probability of retaining an edge \emph{between} communities.
Single values are applied to all communities.
Defaults to \code{0.80}}

\item{max.iterations}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of iterations to attempt to get convergence before erroring out.
Defaults to \code{1000}}
}
