\title{Simulate data following a Exploratory Graph Model (\code{\link[EGAnet]{EGM}})}
\usage{
simEGM(
  communities,
  variables,
  loadings,
  cross.loadings = 0.01,
  correlations,
  sample.size,
  density.power = 3,
  quality = c("acceptable", "robust"),
  max.iterations = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{communities}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of communities to generate}

\item{variables}{Numeric vector (length = 1 or \code{communities}).
Number of variables per community}

\item{loadings}{Numeric (length = 1, \code{communities}, or
total variables \eqn{\times} \code{communities}).
Magnitude of the assigned network loadings.
For reference, small (0.20), moderate (0.35), and large (0.50).
Input can be a loading matrix but must have the dimensions:
total variables \eqn{\times} \code{communities}

Uses \code{runif(n, min = value - 0.075, max = value + 0.075)} for some jitter in the loadings}

\item{cross.loadings}{Numeric (length = 1).
Standard deviation of a normal distribution with a mean of zero (\code{n, mean = 0, sd = value}).
Defaults to \code{0.01}.
Not recommended to change too drastically (small increments such as \code{0.01} work best)}

\item{correlations}{Numeric (length = 1 or
\code{communities} \eqn{\times} \code{communities} matrix).
Magnitude of the community correlations.
Input can be a correlations matrix but must have the dimensions:
\code{communities} \eqn{\times} \code{communities}}

\item{sample.size}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of observations to generate}

\item{density.power}{Numeric (length = 1).
Controls the sparsity of the network loading matrix.
The probability any given cross-loading will be set to zero
is based on the community correlation between two communities
raised to \eqn{\frac{1}{density.power}}. Accepts values between
 \code{1} and \code{Inf} but sparser loadings (i.e., values less than
 \code{3}) can lead to convergence issues.
 Defaults to \code{3}}

\item{quality}{Character (length = 1).
Quality metrics related to the alignment of the correlations
implied by the loadings and network are computed with certain
standards in place to accept a solution.
These metrics include:

\itemize{

\item SRMR (or RMSE) --- standardized root mean residual where
acceptable equals 0.02 and robust equals 0.01

\item MAE --- mean absolute error where
acceptable equals 0.02 and robust equals 0.01

\item \code{\link[EGAnet]{frobenius}} --- Frobenius norm where
acceptable equals 0.90 and robust equals 0.95

\item \code{\link[EGAnet]{jsd}} --- Jensen-Shannon Distance where
acceptable equals 0.05 and robust equals 0.025

}

Defaults to \code{"acceptable"}.
\code{"robust"} is available but most often needs \code{density.power}
to be increased to allow for more cross-loadings to converge}

\item{max.iterations}{Numeric (length = 1).
Number of iterations to attempt to get convergence before erroring out.
Defaults to \code{1000}}
}
