Changes in version 1.3.0

o MAJOR REFACTOR: the update to version 1.3.0 includes many major changes that are designed to improve the reliability and reproducibility of {EGAnet}. The goal of these changes are to eliminate common errors and streamline the code in the package to prevent future error cases. There are several function additions that are provided to facilitate modular use of the {EGAnet} package

o ADD: several internal scripts for "helper" functions that are used across the package (no visible changes for the user)

o ADD: `community.consensus` to apply the Consensus Clustering approach introduced by Lancichnetti & Fortunato (2012). Currently only available for the Louvain implementations

o ADD: `community.detection` to apply community detection algorithms as a standalone function

o ADD: `community.louvain` to apply standard and signed Louvain community detection algorithms as a standalone function

o ADD: convenience function to convert an {igraph} object to a standard matrix (`igraph2matrix`)

o ADD: `modularity` to compute standard (absolute values) and signed modularity (implemented in C)

o ADD: `polychoric.matrix` to compute categorical correlations (implemented in C); handles missing data ("pairwise" or "listwise") as well as empty cells in the joint frequency table (see documentation: `?polychoric.matrix`)

o ADD: `auto.correlate` now computes all correlations internally and no longer depends on external functions; categorical correlations are C based and bi/polyserial correlations are a simplified and vectorized version of {polycor}'s `polyserial`; substantial computational gains (between 10-25x faster than previous use of {qgraph}'s `cor_auto`)

o ADD: `network.estimation` to handle all network estimation in {EGAnet}; *includes* Bayesian GGM from {BGGM} for more seamless incorporation of BEGA

o UPDATE: `EBICglasso.qgraph` and `TMFG` were optimized; `TMFG` is now 2x faster

o UPDATE: `TMFG` can now directly estimate a GGM with the argument 'partial = TRUE'; implements the Local-Global Inversion method from Barfuss et al. (2016)

o ADD: `community.unidimensional` to apply different unidimensional community detection approaches; makes unidimensional community detection more modular and flexible


Changes in version 1.2.5.1

o FIX: cross-loading bug in `net.loads` was leading to problems when there were negative cross-loadings

o FIX: added `psych::factor.scores` scoring methods in `net.scores`

o ADD: `signed.louvain` to estimate the Signed Louvain algorithm (implemented in C)


Changes in version 1.2.5

o ADD: `most_common_tefi` method for `EGA` analyses

o REMOVE: `residualEGA` has been removed in favor of `riEGA` (removes {OpenMx} dependency)

o ADD: rotations to `net.loads` and `net.scores`

o UPDATE: `hierEGA` only outputs specified output (no longer outputs all possible consensus methods and scores combinations -- should be much faster)

o UPDATE: Mac and Linux parallelizations have been optimized

o UPDATE: documented examples are more efficient for CRAN checks


Changes in version 1.2.1

o REMOVE: "alpha" and "adapt" options in `UVA` (removes {fitdistrplus} dependency)

o REMOVE: {qgraph} plots are no longer available

o ADD: `convert2igraph` is now a core function

o ADD: measurement `invariance` function for testing differences in network loadings between groups

o UPDATE: `itemStability` now has a parameter `structure` in which the user can specify a given structure to test its stability.
