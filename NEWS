Changes in version 0.9.4

o FIX: naming typo with characters in `itemStability`

o FIX: NAs in `dimStability`

o FIX: weights of network in unidimensional structure of `EGA` are the same as multidimensional structure

o UPDATE: Added a new function to simulate dynamic factor models `simDFM`

o UPDATE: added internal functions for `net.loads` (see `utils-net.loads`)

o FIX: ordering of names in `itemStability`

o FIX: handling of NA communities in `net.loads`

o UPDATE: Added output of the average replication of items in each dimension for `itemStability`

o UPDATE: Revised 'Network Scores' vignette

o UPDATE: `dimStability` now computes proportion of exact dimension replications rather than items that replicate within dimension

o UPDATE: `net.loads` functionality (cleaned up code)

o UPDATE: S3Methods for `net.loads`

o FIX: `net.scores` negative loadings corrected


Changes in version 0.9.3

o New function and print, summary and plot methods: dynEGA

o New functions: Embed and glla


Changes in version 0.9.2

o UPDATE: add latent variable scores comparison to `net.scores` vignette

o UPDATE: `node.redundant.combine` sets loadings equal to 1 when there are only two variables when the argument type = "latent"; warning also added from type = "sum"

o FIX: `node.redundant` alpha types bug

o updated `itemStability` (bug fixes)

o updated `node.redundant.combine` (bug fixes, latent variable option)

o major bug fix in `net.loads`: corrected loadings greater than 1 when there were many negative values

o added `EGA.estimate` to clean up `EGA` code and allow for future implementations of different network estimation methods and community detection algorithms

o updated `EGA` functionality: message for 'gamma' value used and `EGA.estimate` compatiability

o removed *iterators* dependency

o ordering and name fix in `net.loads`

o auto-adjusts y-axis label size for `itemStability` plot based on number of nodes or length of node names

o `net.loads` adjusted for larger values using absolute values and applying the sign afterwards

o reverse coding update in `net.loads`

o `node.redundant.combine` bug fix for reverse coding latent variables

o added Louvain community detection to all EGA functions in *EGAnet*

o functionality updates to `node.redundant`

o swapped arguments 'type' and 'method' in the `node.redundant` function (fixed examples in other node.redundant functions)

o updated citation


Changes in version 0.9.0

o updated list of dependencies

o added ORCiDs in Description file

o corrected ordering of `net.loads` output

o corrected standard error in `bootEGA`

o citation update

o added function `dimStability` to compute dimensional stability

o added a series of functions for `node.redundant`, which facilitates detecting and combining redundant nodes in networks

o updated the EGA.fit function, so now a correlation matrix can be used as well.


Changes in version 0.8.0

o 'bootEGA' now computes time until bootstrap is finished

o new functions 'cmi', 'pmi' and 'residualEGA' added: 'cmi' computes conditional mutual information, 'pmi' computes partial mutual information and residual EGA computes an EGA network controlling for wording effects

o new dataset 'optimism' added

o documentation and functionality for several functions updated


Changes in version 0.7.0

o fixed 'EGA' bug in 'bootEGA' function; updated 'bootEGA' documentation; added progress messages

o migrated 'net.scores' and 'net.loads' from 'NetworkToolbox' to 'EGAnet' package

o functions 'itemConfirm' and 'itemIdent' have been merged into a single function called, 'itemStability'

o fixed item ordering in 'itemStability' output so dimensions are from least to greatest, the colors match the original community vector input, and updated average standardized network loadings to the 'net.loads' function

o added datasets 'ega.wmt' and 'boot.wmt' for quick user-friendly examples (also removed all '\donttest')

o added package help page

o added package load message

o updated 'itemStability' algorithm (now can accept any number of 'orig.wc') and enforced '0' to '1' bounds on plot
